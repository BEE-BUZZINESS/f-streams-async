/// ## Queue device
///
/// The queue device can be used to desynchronize processing between one or several tasks that produce
/// data and a task that consumes queued data.
///
/// `import { queue } from 'f-streams'`
///
/// * `q = queue(options)`
///   creates a queue.
///   The queue has two properties:
///   `q.reader`: a reader from which you can read the data which has been queued.
///   `q.writer`:  a writer to which you can write data.
///   You can also interact with the queue with the following non-streaming API:
///   `data = q.get()` gets the next item from the queue.
///   `ok = q.put(data)` adds an item to the queue (synchronously).
///   You can pass a `max` option through the `options` parameter when creating the queue.
///   If you pass this option, `q.put(data)` will return true if the data has been queued and false if
///   the data has been discarded because the queue is full.
///   Note that `q.writer will not discard the data but instead will wait for the queue to become available.
